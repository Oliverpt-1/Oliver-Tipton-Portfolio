# About Me

## Oliver Tipton

Hello! My name is Oliver Tipton, and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Davidson College. I am deeply immersed in the blockchain ecosystem, both as a developer and an active market participant. Over the past three years, I have honed my skills in programming fundamentals such as Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms, most recently focusing on blockchain technologies and decentralized finance.

### Experience

I have independently developed blockchain projects and collaborated with fellow Davidson students on various in-class assignments and independent project ideas. My passion for blockchain has driven me to explore innovative solutions and contribute to the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.  I am also currently working for an Ad Tech startup, helping build out some software and automation solutions this Spring. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have competed at the Division 1 level in wrestling, which has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and perseverance.



## Blockchain Development

### Projects

This section of my portfolio showcases two projects that I have built using Solidity:

1. **DAO**: We will be implementing this project as a core part of the Davidson Blockchain Club this coming spring.  It will serve as our governance protocol for voting, funding delegation, and more.
2. **Mock Staking Protocol**: This project serves as a proof-of-concept for staking mechanisms.  It was the first project I built using solidity this past summer.

## Spear

[Spear](https://x.com/whale_spear) is a blockchain analysis software that I began developing in November. What started as a tool to track wallet addresses in the Solana ecosystem has quickly evolved into a more comprehensive platform. 

### Current Developments

We are now expanding into the Base ecosystem, focusing on:
- Monitoring when virtual agents launch and graduate.
- Tracking profitable Base whale addresses.

Additionally, I am developing an AI Agent that will manage the Spear Twitter account starting in February.  I am using the ElizaOS framework, written in Typescript. This AI will conduct research, monitor profitable wallets, and become the go-to Twitter account for degens looking to catch 100x projects early.

### Interests

Outside of my studies and athletics, I have a variety of interests, including:
- **Music**: I love playing guitar, singing, and learning new styles.  Most recently, I completed in bluegrass nationals where I went head to head with the best flatpickers in teh country.
