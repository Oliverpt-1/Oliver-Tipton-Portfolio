`Oliver Tipton Portfolio`

In this repository I included a handful of my projects from various Davidson College courses, research, and independent project work/creation.  Within each project is a readme file that outlines setup and what the project is meant to do.  My primary focus has been in back-end development, specifically Java and Python for traditional Web2 projects and Solidity for Web3 smart contract based projects.  

My strongest languages:
- Java
- Python
- Solidity
- Rust
- C
