`Oliver Tipton Portfolio`

In this repository I included the two Web3 projects that I have worked on thus far.  Within each project is a readme file that outlines setup and what the project is meant to do.  The DAO is in progress and will be a part of the Davidson Blockchain Club that I will be starting on campus when I this fall.  The staking protocol is a mock to show my development skills and capabilities in developing DeFi applications.

My strongest languages:
- Java
- Python
- Solidity
- Rust
- C
