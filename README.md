`About Me`

My name is Oliver Tipton and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Davidson College.  Over the past three years, I have studied Computer Science and programming fundamentals such as Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, and more.  I have independently developed blockchain projects, as well as worked with other Davidson students on in-class assignments and independent project ideas.  In addition to my course load, I have competed at the Division 1 level in wrestling.  This experience has allowed me to continue to grow in discipline and perservence.  Some of my other interests include guitar, singing, and rubik's cubing.


`Portfolio`

This portfolio can be broken up into two main sections: Blockchain portfolio and Spear.  
  `Blockchain Dev`:
  This contains two projects which I have built in Solidity.  The first is the DAO, which we will be implementing as a core part of the Davidson Blockchain Club this coming spring.  The other, is a mock staking protocol which I built as a proof-of-concept.
  `Spear `:
  Spear (https://x.com/whale_spear), is a blockchain analysis software whcih I started building in November.  What started out as a way to track wallet addresses in the Solana ecosystem has quickly evolved.  We are now expanding into the Base ecosystem, including monitoring when virtuals agents launch and graduate, as well as tracking profitable Base whale addresses.  In addition to these, I am developing an AI Agent which will be running the Spear twitter account starting in February.  It will do research, watch profitable wallets, and become the only twitter account needed for degens to catch 100x projects early.
