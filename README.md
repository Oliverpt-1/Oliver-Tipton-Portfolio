# About Me

## Oliver Tipton

Hello! My name is Oliver Tipton, and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Davidson College. I am deeply immersed in the blockchain ecosystem, both as a developer and an active market participant. Over the past three years, I have honed my skills in programming fundamentals such as Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms, most recently focusing on blockchain technologies and decentralized finance.

## CTVBuyer

I am a founding engineer at **CTVBuyer**, an Ad Tech startup where I am helping build out the companyâ€™s first products. My work focuses on developing a scalable analytics dashboard that provides insights into ad performance. This includes tracking impressions, unique exposures, and geo-location analytics.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** TailwindCSS, React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Infrastructure:** API integrations for data ingestion, scalable architecture for future features

My role involves implementing core functionalities for their first in-house product - a dashboard which acts as an all-in-one place for tracking ad-tech data, buying, and selling ad space.

## Blockchain Development

### Projects

This section of my portfolio showcases two projects that I have built using Solidity:

1. **DAO**: We will be implementing this project as a core part of the Davidson Blockchain Club this coming spring. It will serve as our governance protocol for voting, funding delegation, and more.
2. **Mock Staking Protocol**: This project serves as a proof-of-concept for staking mechanisms. It was the first project I built using Solidity this past summer.

## Spear

[Spear](https://x.com/whale_spear) is a blockchain analysis software that I began developing in November. What started as a tool to track wallet addresses in the Solana ecosystem has quickly evolved into a more comprehensive platform.

### Current Developments

We are now expanding into the Base ecosystem, focusing on:
- Monitoring when virtual agents launch and graduate.
- Tracking profitable Base whale addresses.

Additionally, I am developing an AI Agent that will manage the Spear Twitter account starting in February. I am using the ElizaOS framework, written in TypeScript. This AI will conduct research, monitor profitable wallets, and become the go-to Twitter account for degens looking to catch 100x projects early.

### Interests

Outside of my studies and athletics, I have a variety of interests, including:
- **Music**: I love playing guitar, singing, and learning new styles. Most recently, I competed in bluegrass nationals where I went head-to-head with the best flatpickers in the country.
