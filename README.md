`About Me`

My name is Oliver Tipton and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Davidson College.  Over the past three years, I have been able to study many Computer Science fundamental concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, and more.  This has given me the ability to complete independent Web3 projects, as well as work with other Davidson students on in-class assignments and independent project ideas.  In addition to my course load, I have competed at the Division 1 level in wrestling.  This experience has allowed me to continue to grow in discipline and perservence.  Some of my other interests include guitar, singing, and rubik's cubing.


`Portfolio`

I have included the two Web3 projects that I have worked on.  Within each project is a readme file that outlines setup and what the project is meant to do.  The DAO is in progress and will be a part of the Davidson Blockchain Club that I will be starting on campus this fall.  The staking protocol is a mock to show my development skills and capabilities in developing DeFi applications.

I also have included projects from my algorithmic game theory course, which consisted of writing algorithms and implementing them to solve complex games and find nash equilibria.  The code is partially written by the professor as these are homework assignments, however the algorithms themselves were implemented by me and two other students.

My strongest languages:
- Java
- Python
- C
- Solidity
- Rust
