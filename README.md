`Oliver Tipton Portfolio`

In this repository I included the two Web3 projects that I have worked on.  Within each project is a readme file that outlines setup and what the project is meant to do.  The DAO is in progress and will be a part of the Davidson Blockchain Club that I will be starting on campus when I this fall.  The staking protocol is a mock to show my development skills and capabilities in developing DeFi applications.

My strongest languages:
- Java
- Python
- Solidity
- Rust
- C

In addition to coding projects, I have included three writing excerpts of mine to showcase my technical writings skills.  The first is a write up of the Berachain project that I completed as personal research.  The second and third were completed for a Concurrency and Parallel computing course.
